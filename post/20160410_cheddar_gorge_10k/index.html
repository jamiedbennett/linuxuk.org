  <h1>Running the Cheddar Gorge 10k</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 11, 2016</span>
      <p><img src="/media/cheddar_10k1.jpg">
This week I ran the 2016 inaugural Cheddar Gorge Challenge event, the 10k race. Billed as a &lsquo;lumpy course&rsquo; these series of runs offer &ldquo;more climbing just getting to the start than you will in most other events&rdquo;. With the affectionately named Hell Steps towards the end this is a tough run but more importantly, it is a fun event. Cheddar is beautiful, steeped in history and picturesque from the bottom of the gorge let alone from running up and down it so the prospect of completing 3 races (10k, half marathon, and marathon) in and around the area was too enticing to pass up.</p>

<p><img align="left" src="/media/cheddar_10k2.jpg">
The terrain, according to the <a href="http://www.relishrunningraces.com/cheddar-gorge-challenge.php">website</a> is &ldquo;steep in places and very steep everywhere else&rdquo; which sets the scene but to be honest I arrived at the event fully trained but expecting the worse. In reality there were hard sections, easy sections, a little doubt that I could actually complete the event around the 5k mark, and a &lsquo;this is great&rsquo; moment around 7k. The distance is tiny compared to the training I have done but it was a combination of the race-day &lsquo;too fast start pace&rsquo; and the lumpiness that hit my tired legs hard. There was never a time that I truly wanted to give up but there were times when I thought about a brisk walk rather than running. Overall I am happy to say that even up the Hell Steps I broke into a run and completed the course in a not impressive, but rewarding <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/541134242">58:28</a>. I quietly wanted a sub-1hr finish but given the course I was a little sceptical about that but even though the wind was against us most of the race (how does it constantly blow directly at you regardless of your orientation?) I hit my goal.</p>

So why would I put my body through this I hear you ask. Well, this year I am doing something out of my comfort zone, something a little crazy (for me), and something that I hope will make a difference to others. This year I am running, a lot, and for a good reason. This year I am running to raise money for <a href="http://www.macmillan.org.uk/">MacMillan Cancer Support</a>. To read about my story please click the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/JamieBennettRuns">link</a> which is also where you can donate to this very worthy cause. I am putting myself through several challenges, including a marathon in the Himalayas of Nepal and a 45 mile Ultra Marathon because there are people out there who just can&rsquo;t, so lets together make their lives a little easier during a really hard time.</p>

<p>So if you can, please <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/JamieBennettRuns">donate</a>.</p>
